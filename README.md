## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

This repository documents a **methodical and disciplined study of foundational programming and computer science concepts using Python 3**, based on:

- **MIT OpenCourseWare 6.100L**: Introduction to CS and Programming in Python
- **Text Reference**: *Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python* by John V. Guttag (MIT Press)
- **Toolchain**:  
  - IDE: `Spyder` (Scientific Python Development Environment)  
  - Environment: `Miniconda` for package and dependency management

The goal is to:
- Practice through structured Python implementations
- Maintain clean, modular, well-commented code
- Document theory, observations, and conceptual breakdowns

| Directory       | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `src/`           | Core Python scripts implementing structured concepts                   |
| `concepts/`      | Markdown documents explaining each topic in theory                     |
| `notebooks/`     | *(Optional)* Visual, annotated Jupyter notebooks (read-only)           |
| `docs/`          | Supplementary documentation and external references                    |

## ðŸ§ª Methodology

All code is authored under professional modular design practices, including:
- Descriptive function and module docstrings
- Inline commentary for clarity
- Clear separation of executable logic (`src/`) and learning notes (`concepts/`)
- Test-driven validation (where applicable)

---

## ðŸ“Œ Contribution Protocol

For future collaborators:
- All contributions must follow the established `src/` and `concepts/` structure
- Push access requires approval from Muaz Islam Babar
- Each script or document must:
  - Include author attribution
  - Follow the same formatting and docstring conventions
